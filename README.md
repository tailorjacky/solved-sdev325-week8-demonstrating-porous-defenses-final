<h1></h1>

In this homework you use AWS Cloud 9 to create two different unique demonstrations of Porous Defenses such as Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm, Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts, and Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt.

You will provide unique code that contains the vulnerability and then provide an updated version of the code that fixes the vulnerability. You should also describe why the original code was vulnerable and discuss specific attack methods a user could try to exploit the vulnerability. Finally discuss how the new code fixes the vulnerability.

<h1>Assignment Details</h1>

Be sure you have carefully read and understand the materials in weeks 7 and 8.

<ol>

 <li>Select 2 CWE/SANS Top 25 vulnerabilities under the category of <strong>Porous Defenses </strong>from one of these specific issues<strong>: </strong>

  <ol>

   <li>Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm,</li>

   <li>Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts, and</li>

   <li>Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt</li>

  </ol></li>

</ol>

Review and try the existing examples in links in the classroom.  Use AWS Cloud 9 to experiment. Work in multiple languages where possible.

<ol start="2">

 <li>Using AWS Cloud 9, create your own <strong>unique</strong> example for each of the 2 vulnerabilities in this category.</li>

 <li>Your code examples do not need to large or fully functional from an application standpoint. However; they need to include all of the code such that the vulnerability can be fully explained and corrected.</li>

 <li>Use the information in the CWE/SANS Top 25 vulnerabilities to understand and experiment.</li>

 <li>Be sure your documentation and descriptions are detailed and completed.</li>

 <li>You may need to conduct additional research to better understand the vulnerability or the features associated with a specific language.</li>

 <li>Document the vulnerabilities and describe specifically how the issues were corrected. Note: You may need to conduct additional research to better understand the vulnerability or the features associated with a specific language.</li>

</ol>




<h1>Deliverables</h1>

Provide all of your source files for this assignment along with your well-organized documentation (word of PDF file) supporting the files. Be sure to provide all documentation in one word or PDF document. You can compress the source files and documentation into a zip application for easier upload.
